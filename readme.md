<h1>Hi Guys...!!!</h1>

Main concepts in Next.js...


question is, what will be our home page ?
answer is , app-> page.tsx will be your home page

1. Routing and navigation
      <Link />

   firstly go to this link

   umm Routing in nextjs is very different from react routing. In react, we just create route by using react-router-dom in index or app.js file but in this , we create folder in app folder
   lets take example of posts
   src -> app -> posts - >page.tsx ( this would be your structure)
   </br>
now question is, how can i rdirect to the specific post with id in path then the answer is,
you have to create a new folder in post directory... post -> [id] -> page.tsx

2. Metadata
3. Styling (Tailwind CSS)
4. <Image />
5. Client vs Server components

- Data fetching (GET-requests)

6. Server actions (POST/PUT/DELETE)
7. Suspense and streaming
8. Caching
9. Static & dynamic rendering
10. Middleware
11. Production build and deploying
